# PaperChainExplorer

**An interactive graph-based application to explore academic paper connections.**  
PaperChainExplorer helps researchers, students, and academic professionals visualize and analyze the relationships between academic papers, authors, and institutions. With an easy-to-use interface, users can explore citation chains and co-authorships within the research domain.

> **Note:** The concept of "topics" has not yet been integrated into the application. It is planned as a future enhancement.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Inspiration
Inspired by the idea of uncovering hidden connections in academic research, this project seeks to help researchers and students rediscover forgotten ideas and foster innovation.

## üöÄ Features
- Visualize relationships between academic papers, authors, and (future) topics with interactive graphs.
- Query paths between papers (e.g., "How is my paper connected to the Transformer paper?").
- Explore citation networks and shared authorships interactively.
- Wondering if your *mediocre* paper connects to a groundbreaking one like *"Attention Is All You Need"*? PaperChainExplorer helps uncover these surprising relationships.
- Simple and intuitive user interface built with **Streamlit**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python - Handles application logic, integrates with Neo4j, and fetches data from external sources.
- **Database**: Neo4j - Graph database used to store and query relationships between academic papers, authors.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit - Provides an interactive user interface for visualizing the graph and performing queries.
- **APIs**: OpenAlex API - Fetches data on academic papers, authors, and institutions for use in the application.

## üß© Deployment
To deploy the app to your own server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koyonkym/paper-chain-explorer.git
   ```
2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   cd paper-chain-explorer
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up a Neo4j instance (locally or in the cloud) and configure the connection.

4. Set up the following environment variables:
   - `NEO4J_URI` - URI of the Neo4j instance.
   - `NEO4J_USERNAME` - Username for Neo4j authentication.
   - `NEO4J_PASSWORD` - Password for Neo4j authentication.
   - `OPENALEX_EMAIL` - Email address for OpenAlex API usage.
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for OpenAI services.

   Example setup in Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
   export NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
   export NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
   export NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"
   export OPENALEX_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

5. Create the graph in the Neo4j database by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python src/setup_database.py
   ```
   This step fetches data from the OpenAlex API and populates the Neo4j database with the initial graph.

6. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

## üß™ Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
This will run all the unit tests located in the `tests/` directory.

## üîç Example Query
- "How is Paper A connected to Paper B?"
   - This query will visualize citation chains or shared authors between the two papers.

- "Who are the authors of the paper 'Attention Is All You Need'?"
   - This will retrieve and visualize the authorship relationship of the paper.

- "Find all papers related to 'Transformer models'"
   - **Future Work**: This query is not currently supported as the app does not use vector embeddings for semantic similarity. Currently, only citation-based connections are displayed. Enhancing the app to include this feature is planned for a future update.
